#Week 3 Quiz

#1.Take a look at the 'iris' dataset that comes with R. 
#The data can be loaded with the code:

library(datasets)
data(iris)

#A description of the dataset can be found by running

?iris
        
#There will be an object called 'iris' in your workspace. 
#In this dataset, what is the mean of 'Sepal.Length' for the species virginica?
#Please round your answer to the nearest whole number.

##iris is a data frame with 150 cases (rows) and 5 variables (columns) named 
#Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width, and Species.

str(iris)       #Info of iris variables
head(iris)      #First 6 lines of the iris dataset
View(iris)      #Open the iris dataset in the editor

#Extract the data from Species = "virginica" to a subset of iris
virginica <- subset(iris,Species == "virginica")

summary(virginica)      #Statistical information for every column
mean(virginica$Sepal.Length)    #Mean value of the Sepal.length column 
round(mean(virginica$Sepal.Length))     #round value


#2.Continuing with the 'iris' dataset from the previous Question, 
#what R code returns a vector of the means of the variables 'Sepal.Length', 
#'Sepal.Width', 'Petal.Length', and 'Petal.Width'?

apply(iris, 1, mean)
apply(iris, 2, mean)
rowMeans(iris[, 1:4])
apply(iris[, 1:4], 1, mean)
colMeans(iris)
apply(iris[, 1:4], 2, mean) #Correct

#3.Load the 'mtcars' dataset in R with the following code

library(datasets)
data(mtcars)

#There will be an object names 'mtcars' in your workspace. 
#You can find some information about the dataset by running

?mtcars

#How can one calculate the average miles per gallon (mpg) by number 
#of cylinders in the car (cyl)? Select all that apply.

sapply(split(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl), mean)     #Correct
tapply(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl, mean)            #correct
tapply(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$mpg, mean)
sapply(mtcars, cyl, mean)
split(mtcars, mtcars$cyl)
mean(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl)
with(mtcars, tapply(mpg, cyl, mean))            #Correct
apply(mtcars, 2, mean)
lapply(mtcars, mean)

#4.Continuing with the 'mtcars' dataset from the previous Question, 
#what is the absolute difference between the average horsepower of 
#4-cylinder cars and the average horsepower of 8-cylinder cars?

#(Please round your final answer to the nearest whole number. 
#Only enter the numeric result and nothing else.)

diff <- tapply(mtcars$hp, mtcars$cyl, mean)
round(abs(diff[3]-diff[1]))

#OR 

abs(mean(mtcars$hp[mtcars$cyl==4])-mean(mtcars$hp[mtcars$cyl==8]))

#5 If you run

debug(ls)

#what happens when you next call the 'ls' function?

# a) The 'ls' function will return an error.
# b) The 'ls' function will execute as usual.
# c) Execution of 'ls' will suspend at the beginning of the 
#    function and you will be in the browser.---> Correct
# d) You will be prompted to specify at which line of the function 
#    you would like to suspend execution and enter the browser.

#If you run ls() after that you enter in the debugging browser
#To exit Q and C in the Browser>
